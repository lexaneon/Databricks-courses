/*To provide recommendations based on the ratings given by users, 
* we can use a technique called Collaborative Filtering. 
* This is based on the concept that if person A and B have given similar ratings to the same objects, 
* then they must have similar taste. Therefore, there is a higher probability that person A will like an object they havenâ€™t 
* come across but is rated highly by B.

To perform collaborative filtering, we will use an algorithm called ALS (Alternating Least Squares), 
which will make predictions about how much each user would rate each book and ultimately provide recommendations
for every user listed in the dataset.*/
